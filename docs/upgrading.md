# Upgrading, and bringing another computer up to date

One person's accounts are usually spread over more than one computer, and each computer keeps its own
configuration, its own tokens and its own MCP registrations. Nothing is shared between them, so each one is
brought up to date on its own, with the sequence below. It works from any earlier release: a computer still on
0.1.x with the old flat names (`work`, `personal`) ends on the current release with organisation/platform names
(`acme/gmail`, `acme/slack`) and its MCP servers — Gmail, Slack and, from 0.5.0, the core server; from 0.7.0 Resend
and WhatsApp too, where this computer uses them — registered.

Why the order matters:

- **The rename is permanent.** An old name becomes a tombstone: it is refused from then on, with the name it has
  now, and never reused. `--dry-run` first is not optional.
- **A release older than 0.2.0 cannot read the renamed configuration at all**, and a server that started before
  the rename still offers the old names. So every agent client is closed before the rename and reopened after the
  new servers are registered, never the other way round.
- **Each registration pins an exact version.** A new release reaches a client only when it is registered again,
  which is what `mcp install --force` does.

## The short way: `agentcomms update`

From the release that adds `agentcomms update`, a computer whose accounts already have organisation/platform names is
brought to the latest release by one command — or from a chat, by the core server's `comms_update`:

```bash
npx -y @agentcomms/core@latest update --check   # what is behind the latest release; changes nothing
npx -y @agentcomms/core@latest update           # one change for every step, approved before any of it happens
```

`--check` (`check: true` from a chat) reads the npm registry and this computer and asks nobody. It lists every client
registration of the core's and every channel's server — Gmail, Slack, Resend and WhatsApp — pinned to an older
release, the managed runtimes those will need, and the `@agentcomms` packages installed globally, each with the
version it has and the latest. It asks the registry only about the packages this computer uses.

Without `--check` it prepares one change and shows every step of it: each registration registered again at the latest
release under the name, client, scope, launcher and pins it has now; each runtime it installs; each
`npm install -g <package>@<version>`. Nothing happens until you approve it, as for any other change: at a terminal you
type `yes` (or, under the `confirm` change policy, the code it shows); an agent gets the preview and an approval id,
and calls again with it — `--approval <id>`, or `approvalId` — once you have agreed. The approval is for those steps at
those versions: a release published in between is a different change, and is refused. With nothing behind, it says
so and prepares nothing.

It never widens an entry. The pins it keeps are exactly the ones the entry has; an entry whose pins it cannot carry
over as they are — one registered for a single project, one written by hand, one pinned to an account since renamed,
one whose client's own command is not on `PATH` — is left as it was and listed with what to run instead. It reports
each step as it went, then says which clients to restart. Restart them, then prune the old runtimes from the restarted
server, as in step 7.

### The daily check

From the release that adds it, a machine does not wait to be asked. Once a day — at most, for the whole machine — the
first server or command to run asks npm for the latest release of `@agentcomms/core`, runs the same "what is behind"
check as `update --check`, and records what it found in `update-check.json` in the state directory. When a newer
release is out:

- **every MCP tool call stops** — except `comms_update`, `comms_doctor`, `comms_paths`, each channel's doctor, and a
  call carrying the `approvalId` of an approval the person already gave that is still waiting to be used (an empty or
  made-up id does not count, nor one already used, revoked or expired; Resend's send status, which looks a send up by
  its approval, counts the send's whatever became of it; and a call that takes one but would not use it — a report, a
  dry run — refuses it) — and answers "Hang on a minute, there's an update. Let's
  update first.", with the running and latest versions and the two ways on. When every registration of that server on
  this machine already names the latest release, and only the running server is old, it says to restart the client
  instead. The Claude Code plugin's Gmail server and the Gemini extension's servers are always told to update — each
  says, as it starts, that the plugin or the extension started it — because they run the release it pins, which
  restarting starts again: update them where they were installed, or put it off. So is a server of a channel with a
  registration that pins no release — a checkout's own, or an entry written by hand. A server started from a client
  configuration the check does not read goes by its channel's registrations;
- **every command stops** — except `update`, `doctor`, `paths`, `approve`, `approvals`, `mcp` on its own (the server,
  which stops each call itself; `mcp install` and `mcp prune` are stopped like any other command), the listener a
  sign-in starts (`agent-gmail oauth-listen`, `agent-slack sign-in-listen`), the hidden `update-check-child` a
  command starts to finish the day's check, WhatsApp's `status`, and a command
  that takes `--approval` carrying one still waiting to be used (a command that takes none refuses it, and so does
  one that would not use it: a report, a dry run, a `--finish`) — and at a
  terminal asks "Update now, later today, or
  cancel?". Now runs `update`, with its own preview, and says "Updated. Run your command again." only when it
  brought this command to the latest release; otherwise it says what is left and exits non-zero. Later puts it off;
  cancel does nothing. Anything without a terminal — a script, an agent, `--json` — exits `11` (`UPDATE_REQUIRED`),
  naming this installation's own `update` and `update --later` commands — its Node and core's CLI file, its folders
  pinned — to run exactly as given; on Windows with Node under `C:\Program Files` they come as words to type. A
  command whose release is installed globally while an
  older copy of it runs — from npx's cache, or a project's own install — stops the same way, and says to run the
  installed one.

"Not now" (`agentcomms update --later`, or `comms_update` with `later: true`) is a change the person approves, like
any other, and lasts until midnight, local time, for the whole machine. `agentcomms update --auto off` (or `auto:
"off"`) turns the check off for this machine, also approved; `--auto on` turns it back on at once. `doctor` shows the
check on one line: on or off, when it last asked, the latest release, and the one running.

It never gets in the way of a machine that cannot reach npm: an ask that fails keeps the last result, stops nothing,
and is not tried again that day. A prerelease never counts as an update. A command at a terminal waits about three
seconds for the answer at most, then goes on while the ask finishes beside it, so a slow registry is still heard from;
a server never waits for it. The ask that goes on is handed to a detached process of its own, which holds none of the
command's output, so the command's process ends when the command does: on the day's first run a script's `$(…)`, a
pipe into `jq` or an agent's shell tool waits at most about three seconds longer than usual, and never for npm's
registry or `npm ls` behind it. Where that process cannot be started, the command asks in its own process, as before, and ends
once the ask has. An ask cut short — a process ended part-way — does not use up the day: another process asks a
couple of minutes later. WhatsApp's server and command, which never reach the network, do not ask npm
themselves; they stop once any other server or command on the machine has found an update. The check is skipped
entirely when `CI` is set, or when `AGENT_COMMS_UPDATE_CHECK=off`.

Everything below is the long way round — and the only way across the rename, which `update` does not do.

## Before you start

- **Node 22.12 or newer — 22.16 or newer for WhatsApp**, first on `PATH` in the terminal you use: `node --version`.
  The registration records the absolute path of this Node, so it is the one your agents will run. WhatsApp refuses
  an older one, naming the version it needs: it reads WhatsApp's store with Node's own SQLite.
- **The client's own CLI on `PATH`** — `claude` for Claude Code, `codex` for Codex. `mcp install` registers through
  it; without it the install prints the entry for you to add by hand instead of registering it.
- **The release to install.** Every command below uses the same one, so a release published halfway through does
  not leave the two servers on different versions:

  ```bash
  V=$(npm view @agentcomms/gmail version); echo "$V"
  ```

  It must be 0.5.0 or later: the steps below are written for it — the approvals in steps 3 and 4, and the core
  server, arrived in 0.5.0.

## 1. Close every agent client

Quit Claude Code (every window, and the VS Code extension), Codex, Cursor, Claude Desktop — whatever runs these
servers on this computer. A server that is still running keeps the version and the names it started with.

The one exception is an agent doing this for you from inside Claude Code: it cannot close its own window. That is
harmless — its Gmail and Slack servers go stale at the rename, refusing the old names or the new file, and nothing
they do can undo it — as long as the window is reopened in step 7. Close every other one.

Do not rename while a sign-in is waiting in a browser. If you started one in the last ten minutes, finish it first;
one that completes after the rename is refused.

## 2. See what the names would become

```bash
npx -y @agentcomms/core@$V names migrate --dry-run
```

Each account's default is `<old name>/<platform>`: `work` → `work/gmail`, `team` → `team/slack`. Where that is not
what you want, add a `--rename <old>=<new>` for it:

```bash
npx -y @agentcomms/core@$V names migrate --dry-run \
  --rename <old>=<organisation>/gmail \
  --rename <old>=<organisation>/slack
```

Write the list once, for every name on every computer, and run the same list everywhere. A `--rename` for a name
this computer does not have is shown under "Not applicable here" and changes nothing. Read that list: a misspelt
name lands there too, and the account it was meant for would take its default instead. If the same word is both
a mailbox and a Slack workspace, qualify it: `--rename inbox:<old>=…` or `--rename account:<old>=…`.

If it says the names are already organisation/platform, this computer was migrated before; go to step 4.

## 3. Rename

The same command without `--dry-run`. Renaming every account is a change a person approves. At a terminal it shows
the mapping and the change and asks you to type `yes` — or, under the `confirm` change policy, the code it shows.
Anything without a terminal — an agent, a script — gets the preview and an approval id instead, and exits `10`; once
you have agreed, it runs the same command again with `--approval <id>`:

```bash
npx -y @agentcomms/core@$V names migrate \
  --rename <old>=<organisation>/gmail \
  --rename <old>=<organisation>/slack
# without a terminal: exit 10, the preview and an approval id. Once you have said yes:
npx -y @agentcomms/core@$V names migrate --approval <id> \
  --rename <old>=<organisation>/gmail \
  --rename <old>=<organisation>/slack
```

The approval is for exactly the mapping shown: run again with a `--rename` left off, it is refused and nothing
changes. Releases before the core MCP server took `--yes` here instead; `npx -y @agentcomms/core@$V --help` says which
yours takes.

It saves the configuration as it was beside itself first, as `config.json.before-names-migrate-<UTC time>`
(owner-only), and prints where. That copy is the only way back; keep it until everything works.

## 4. Register the servers

**First, decide how changes are approved. From 0.5.0 a loosening is approved in chat by default.** A configuration
from an earlier release has no change policy, and reads as `chat`: a registration, a looser send policy or a removed
account is approved by a yes in the conversation, where 0.4.x asked for a code typed at a terminal — and the software
cannot tell your yes from an agent's. To keep terminal approval, run this before letting an agent loose on this
computer. It applies at once; going back needs the code:

```bash
npx -y @agentcomms/core@$V policy confirm
```

Then register the servers:

```bash
npx -y @agentcomms/gmail@$V mcp install --client claude-code --force
npx -y @agentcomms/slack@$V mcp install --client claude-code --force
npx -y @agentcomms/resend@$V mcp install --client claude-code --force     # from 0.7.0, if you use it
npx -y @agentcomms/whatsapp@$V mcp install --client claude-code --force   # from 0.7.0, if you use it
npx -y @agentcomms/core@$V mcp install --client claude-code --force       # the core server, if you use it
```

Each registration is a change a person approves, as the rename is: at a terminal it shows what it will register —
which server, which client, under which name, pinned to what, replacing what — and you type `yes` (or, under the
`confirm` change policy, the code it shows). Anything without a terminal — an agent, a script — gets that preview and
an approval id instead, exits `10`, and runs the same command again with `--approval <id>` once you have agreed:

```bash
npx -y @agentcomms/gmail@$V mcp install --client claude-code --force
# without a terminal: exit 10, the preview and an approval id. Once you have said yes:
npx -y @agentcomms/gmail@$V mcp install --client claude-code --force --approval <id>
```

The approval is for exactly the registration shown: run again with another flag, it is refused and nothing is
written. Releases before this one registered the Gmail and Slack servers without asking and have no `--approval`
there; `--help` on that command says which yours is. The core server exists from the release
that adds `agentcomms mcp`; `npx -y @agentcomms/core@$V --help` lists it.

For another client, change `--client` (`codex`, `cursor`, `claude-desktop`, `gemini`, `vscode`). `--force` replaces
the entry that is already there, which is how an upgrade reaches a registered client.

Each result should say the entry was registered and that the server started. If it only printed an entry, the
client's CLI was not found: see "Before you start".

`--force` never widens the entry it replaces: a pin to one mailbox or workspace, or `--read-only`, that the entry
had and the command leaves out is kept, and the result says so in a warning. The pin it keeps is the name the
entry was registered with, though, and after the rename that is the **old** one, which is refused. So if an
existing entry was registered with its own flags — a different `--name`, `--read-only`, or pinned to one mailbox
or workspace — pass the same flags again, with the pinned account's **new** name. `agent-gmail doctor` prints the
exact command for each stale Gmail entry; see
[Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#the-server-is-running-an-old-version). To register a wider server on
purpose, remove the entry with the client's own command (`claude mcp remove gmail --scope user`) and install again.

## 5. Upgrade the global commands, where there are any

Only if you installed them globally before (`npm ls -g --depth=0 | grep @agentcomms`):

```bash
npm install -g @agentcomms/gmail@$V @agentcomms/slack@$V @agentcomms/core@$V   # only the ones listed
npm install -g @agentcomms/resend@$V @agentcomms/whatsapp@$V                   # likewise, from 0.7.0
```

## 6. Check it

```bash
npx -y @agentcomms/gmail@$V doctor
npx -y @agentcomms/gmail@$V inbox list
npx -y @agentcomms/gmail@$V whoami --inbox <organisation>/gmail        # once for each mailbox
npx -y @agentcomms/gmail@$V whoami --inbox <an old name>              # refused, with its new name
npx -y @agentcomms/slack@$V workspace list
npx -y @agentcomms/slack@$V doctor --offline
npx -y @agentcomms/resend@$V doctor                                    # from 0.7.0, where you use them
npx -y @agentcomms/resend@$V account list
npx -y @agentcomms/whatsapp@$V status
```

## 7. Reopen the clients

Reopen them, and check that the tools of every server you registered are there — Gmail's and Slack's, and Resend's
and WhatsApp's where you use them. Then remove the old servers' runtimes, which stay on disk otherwise. `prune` keeps a runtime named in any client config it reads, one it printed an entry for, and one
a running process uses, and it removes nothing if one of those configs cannot be read. The configs it reads include
every one `mcp install` recorded registering into, so a Claude Code account under another `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, or
codex under another `CODEX_HOME`, counts even when this shell does not set it; a recorded config that has since been
deleted keeps nothing. That record starts with 0.4.1: an entry an earlier release registered under another
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` or `CODEX_HOME` is known only once it has been registered again, so do step 4 for every such
account before running `prune`, or run it from a shell with that variable set. It does not read a workspace's own
`.vscode/mcp.json` or `.cursor/mcp.json`, so if you registered a runtime there by hand, look at
`mcp prune --dry-run` first. Run it after the clients are back:

```bash
npx -y @agentcomms/gmail@$V mcp prune
npx -y @agentcomms/slack@$V mcp prune
npx -y @agentcomms/resend@$V mcp prune     # from 0.7.0, if you use it
npx -y @agentcomms/whatsapp@$V mcp prune   # from 0.7.0, if you use it
npx -y @agentcomms/core@$V mcp prune
```

Each asks you to approve the runtimes it lists before it deletes them, the way step 4 asks, and removes no more than
that list; without a terminal it exits `10` with the list and an approval id, for `mcp prune --approval <id>`.

## Accounts this computer does not have yet

Nothing copies an account between computers: a sign-in is per computer, and it needs you in a browser.

```bash
npx -y @agentcomms/gmail@$V inbox add <organisation>/gmail
npx -y @agentcomms/slack@$V workspace add <organisation>/slack --client-id <the app's Client ID> --port <its port>
npx -y @agentcomms/resend@$V account add <organisation>/resend   # type the API key when asked
```

For a Slack workspace connected on another computer, use the same app: on that computer,
`agent-slack workspace show <organisation>/slack --json` gives its Client ID (`oauthClientId`), and
`agent-slack manifest --workspace <organisation>/slack --json` its port (`port`).

A Resend key is typed by a person at this computer's terminal (or given as `RESEND_API_KEY`), never read from a
chat. Use the same key, or create one for this computer in Resend's dashboard, and pass the same `--mode` and
`--send` the account has elsewhere. Register its server with
`npx -y @agentcomms/resend@$V mcp install --client claude-code`, adding `--account <organisation>/resend` to pin it.
A WhatsApp account is per Mac: see the next section.

## WhatsApp, and the spike before it

WhatsApp reads a file on the Mac it runs on, so an account is added on each Mac, at its own terminal — macOS asks
there for permission to read WhatsApp's data:

```bash
npx -y @agentcomms/whatsapp@$V add <organisation>/whatsapp
npx -y @agentcomms/whatsapp@$V sync --account <organisation>/whatsapp
npx -y @agentcomms/whatsapp@$V mcp install --client claude-code --account <organisation>/whatsapp
```

A Mac that ran the unpublished spike has its accounts in `whatsapp-spike.json`. The first `agent-whatsapp` command, or
the first start of its server, moves them into `config.json` once — same account ids, so the index is read as it is
with no new sync, and the chat lists come too — and keeps the old file as `whatsapp-spike.json.migrated-<time>`. It
opens neither WhatsApp's store nor the spike's index to do it. A server the spike's checkout registered by hand is not
one this release updates: register the published one with `mcp install` as above, and remove the old entry from the
client.

## Example: one person's mapping

For illustration only — these are one owner's accounts, not names to copy. Six mailboxes and two Slack workspaces,
spread over several computers:

| Old name | New name | Needs a `--rename`? |
|---|---|---|
| `gmail` | `personal/gmail` | yes |
| `cue` | `cue/gmail` | no, the default |
| `rgc` | `rgc/gmail` | no, the default |
| `wf` | `wf/gmail` | no, the default |
| `wf-tech` | `wf/gmail-tech` | yes |
| `beamtech` | `beamtech/gmail` | no, the default |
| `live` (Slack) | `cue/slack` | yes |
| `slack-2` (Slack) | `rgc/slack` | yes |

So the list run on every one of those computers is four flags — `--rename gmail=personal/gmail`,
`--rename wf-tech=wf/gmail-tech`, `--rename live=cue/slack` and `--rename slack-2=rgc/slack` — and a computer that
has only some of those accounts lists the renames it has no account for as not applicable.

## A prompt for an agent on the other computer

Paste this into Claude Code on the computer being upgraded, with your own list in place of `<RENAMES>` — the
`--rename` flags from step 2 — and your full set of new names in place of `<ALL NEW NAMES>`. Claude Code cannot
restart itself, so it does everything up to step 7 and then tells you to.

```text
Bring agent-communications on this computer up to the current release: rename accounts to organisation/platform
names, and register the Gmail, Slack and core MCP servers with Claude Code. Follow docs/upgrading.md from
https://github.com/crissmoldovan/agent-communications exactly, in its order.

Rules:
- Never send mail, post to Slack, or start a sign-in. Never print a token, a secret, or an env value.
- Before registering any server, tell me that from 0.5.0 a change is approved by my yes in chat unless the change
  policy is confirm, and ask me whether to run `npx -y @agentcomms/core@$V policy confirm`. Run it only if I say so.
- When a preview says its policy is confirm, give me the approve command the result gives, exactly as given, to run
  in my own terminal, and wait until I say it is done before running the command again with --approval <id>. Never
  run approve yourself, and never write one yourself.
- Stop and tell me, changing nothing further, if any command fails or any of these is true:
  - `node --version` is older than 22.12, or `claude` is not on PATH;
  - the release (V=$(npm view @agentcomms/gmail version)) is older than 0.5.0;
  - an existing gmail or slack entry in Claude Code is not @agentcomms (another vendor's server with that name);
  - an @agentcomms server is registered under another name, or its entry carries any of the flags --inbox,
    --workspace, --read-only (tell me which, so they can be carried over);
  - the dry run renames an account to a name that is not in <ALL NEW NAMES>.
- Use these renames on every run: <RENAMES>
- Run the dry run first and show me its output, including anything "Not applicable here". Then run it without
  --dry-run: it exits 10 with a preview and an approval id. Show me the preview and wait for my yes, then run the
  same command again with --approval <id>. Tell me the backup path it prints.
- Register the Gmail, Slack and core servers with --client claude-code --force, using the same V for all three. Each
  one exits 10 with a preview and an approval id first, having registered nothing: show me that preview exactly as
  it is and wait for my yes, then run the same command again with --approval <id>. Never pass an --approval I have
  not agreed to, and if a rerun is refused, show me the new preview rather than retrying. Each result must say
  registered and verified; if not, stop and show it.
- Upgrade global @agentcomms commands only if they are already installed globally.
- Run the checks in step 6. For each name in <ALL NEW NAMES> that this computer does not have, give me the one
  command that connects it, without running it.
- Close nothing yourself. Finally, tell me to quit and reopen every Claude Code window, this one included.
```
