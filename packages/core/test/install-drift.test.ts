/*
 * A registration is agreed to — or found to need nobody's agreement — on what `plan` saw, and carried out a moment
 * later by `apply`. The machine can move in between: a client's CLI turns up on PATH, an entry the plan was going to
 * replace is removed by somebody else. What a person was shown has to be what then happens, so everything that
 * decides what the install does — whether it writes or only prints, where it writes, which entries it replaces and
 * what the server is pinned to — is carried from the plan into the apply, looked at again there, and a difference is
 * a refusal, with nothing written.
 *
 * The surface tests move the machine inside one call, the way it moves under a real one: the first time the
 * installer looks for a client on PATH is the plan's look, and every later one the apply's. Every test runs in a
 * temporary home with a PATH holding only stand-ins that record what they were asked; nothing touches a real client,
 * config, keychain or npm.
