/**
 * The command a person is told to run for one of this suite's own CLIs (design 2026-10-04, D1 and D5; CUE-403).
 *
 * A bare `agent-gmail approve …` is not runnable for most of the people it is printed for: a package run by npx, by a
 * managed runtime or from a checkout puts nothing on their PATH. So every such command names this process's Node and
 * a checked file of the product it runs, with the suite directories it uses pinned as options — and when no file can
 * be checked, there is no command at all, only a sentence saying what is missing. The caller says which package it is
 * and what to run; it never supplies the program or quotes the line.
 *
 * Three directions. A product's own CLI is found from the product itself, walking from one of its own modules to its
 * manifest: no registration is ever asked. A channel's handoff to core is found the way the channel itself finds core,
 * through its installed dependency, and only the same release. Another product's command is found among the servers
 * registered with the person's MCP clients, which the caller scanned and passes in: only a file-backed registration of
 * exactly the printing package's version, checked on disk. Nothing a registration names is run, or asked anything —
 * not even its interpreter for a version: no installer wrote down where a scanned entry came from, so none is trusted
 * to run (D1). This module never scans, spawns or probes.
 *
 * What is checked is checked when the command is printed, not for ever (D6): the file it names is real, readable and
 * inside its package then, and a later change to that installation is a later fact.
