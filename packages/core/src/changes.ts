/**
 * Change approvals: how a loosening of the configuration, or an act that cannot be taken back, is agreed to by a
 * person from either surface — a chat with an agent, or a terminal.
 *
 * The shape is a send's, over a change instead of a message. A product computes the change without writing it and
 * calls `prepareChange`, which stores an approval bound to exactly that change and returns the preview to show. The
 * person agrees — in the conversation under the `chat` change policy, or by `agentcomms approve <id>` and a typed
 * code under `confirm`. The product computes the change again and calls `claimChange`, which proves it is the same
 * change and returns the `LooseningConsent` that `ConfigStore.update` demands. Nothing here writes the configuration:
 * `ConfigStore.update` stays the one place a loosening is refused or let through, and a claimed approval is only a
 * second source of the consent it already requires.
 *
 * The policy that decides is the one in force *before* the change, read from the file by the core rather than taken
 * from the caller. Otherwise moving `changePolicy` from `confirm` to `chat` would be approved under the `chat` it
 * was asking for.
