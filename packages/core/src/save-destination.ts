/**
 * Where a download is saved: the person's to say, every time.
 *
 * A Gmail attachment or a Slack file is a stranger's file, and where it lands on this machine is not a thing a tool
 * should decide for the person — nor an agent, which is who calls the tool. So a download asks first. The first call
 * reads what the request names and saves nothing: it lists the files, by name and size, and offers three places — the
 * person's Downloads folder (or the one they set as `defaults.downloadsDir`), the folder the command or the server
 * was started in, or a folder they name — each of the first two by its exact path, or as unavailable, with the
 * reason, when it is a folder no download may be written into (`save-deny.ts`). The question is kept in the approval
 * store as a `download` record, so it expires, is claimed once, and is bound to the account, the request and the files
 * it listed. The second call carries the person's answer and the question's id, and only then is anything written.
 *
 * The question is held to the change policy of the mailbox or workspace the files come from. Under `chat` the answer
 * an agent relays from the conversation is the person's, as every other approval here is under `chat`. Under
 * `confirm` it has to come from where an agent cannot answer: the person at their own terminal — the channel's
 * `approve` with the question's id, or the download command itself asking them there — or a form a trusted client
 * shows them. An answer passed as a tool argument or a flag is then refused, and the question left open.
 *
 * At a terminal with a person at it the command asks there and then (`downloadAtTerminal`); a person at a terminal
 * may also answer by flag, `--to`, with nobody to ask; an agent, a pipe or `--json` gets the question and the id, as
 * over MCP, and runs the command again with the answer.
 *
 * Nothing here is an operation: the channels' `downloadAttachments` and `downloadFiles` are, and both surfaces reach
 * them. This is what they share of the asking.
