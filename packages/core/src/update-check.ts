/**
 * The daily update check's checker: the half that asks the registry (design 2026-09-28 §1).
 *
 * At most once in 24 hours for the whole machine, it reads the `latest` dist-tag of `@agentcomms/core` — every
 * package here is released together under one version, so that one number is the latest of each — and runs the same
 * "what is behind" check `comms_update` runs with `check`, handing it that number, so the registry is asked once. What
 * it found goes in `update-check.json`, where every server and command reads it.
 *
 * Two processes finding the file a day old at the same moment do not both ask: the first to take the file's lock
 * claims the check (`checking`), and the second, reading the file under the same lock, finds it claimed. The day's
 * `lastChecked` is written when the ask is over, so an ask cut short — a command the person interrupted, a server
 * whose client closed it — does not use up the day: its claim runs out (`UPDATE_CHECK_LEASE_MS`) and the next process
 * asks. An ask that fails — offline, a registry that does not answer — is recorded as the day's ask, keeps the last
 * result, and stops nothing. It never throws.
 *
 * Nothing here gives up on the registry sooner than the registry's own timeout: a command at a terminal stops
 * *waiting* after about three seconds and goes on, and the check carries on beside it — in a detached child of its
 * own (`UPDATE_CHECK_CHILD_COMMAND`), so the command's process, and its output, end when the command does (#48). Cut
 * off at three seconds, a registry that takes five would have been asked every day and heard from never.
 *
 * WhatsApp imports none of this: see `update-state.ts`.
