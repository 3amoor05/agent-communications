 *
 * This module is what the profile *is* and what the configuration records of it: the strict schema a document has to
 * pass (§D1, §D2), how it is read from a file (§D3), how it is shown (§D2), and — over the `organisations` record and
 * the client rows — the generations of its Google client, which of them a profile resolves to, and how far the
 * configuration has drifted from what was approved (§D4, §D8). It writes nothing: `operations/organisations.ts` is the
 * one place a profile changes the configuration, each change approved first.
 *
 * **A profile is data, never code, and none of it is trusted.** Every field comes from whoever wrote the document, so
 * each has a grammar and a bound, an unknown key is an error, and the two free-text fields are neutralised and put on
 * one line wherever they are shown. The client secret is never shown anywhere — not in a preview, an effect, an error,
