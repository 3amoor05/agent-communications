/**
 * A command line for a person to copy and run, each word quoted only where the shell it is pasted into would need it.
 * Every command this suite prints to be run — a change to run again with its approval, a folder to take out, an entry
 * to register again or remove — is quoted here, when the locator or `externalCommand` makes it, so no printer quotes
 * for a shell of its own.
 *
 * Everywhere but Windows that shell is a POSIX one, and a word goes in single quotes, inside which nothing is special
 * but the quote itself. Windows has two shells, and neither reads single quotes that way: cmd.exe does not take them
 * as quotes at all, so `'C:\Profiles\First Last\outgoing'` reached the command as two words, quote marks and all, and
 * PowerShell does, but escapes a quote inside them by doubling it rather than as `'\''`. A command printed on Windows
 * has to be safe in both, because nothing says which one it will be pasted into (CUE-306) — and safe is not enough:
 * the program has to receive the same words from either. Three readers stand between the line and the program. cmd.exe
 * hands the program the line as it is, and the program's own parser (the C runtime's, Node's) splits it. PowerShell
 * reads the line itself, a double-quoted word with its backslashes as plain characters, and then writes a new command
 * line for the program: Windows PowerShell 5.1 the old way ("Legacy" in about_Parsing, "Passing arguments to native
 * applications") — a word quoted only when it holds whitespace, as it is, and an empty word dropped — and PowerShell
 * 7.3 and later its own way ("Standard") — quoted when it must be, with every backslash before a quote doubled. For a
 * `.cmd` script, which is how npm installs `agentcomms`, `claude` and `codex` on Windows, PowerShell 7 goes back to the
 * old way, and cmd.exe then reads that new line. So on Windows:
 *
 * - A word of letters, digits and `_ + = : . / \`, with `@` and `-` anywhere but first, is left as it is: no reader
 *   does anything with it, and a backslash is an ordinary character to all of them, at the end too. A first `@` is
 *   splatting to PowerShell, and a `,` its array operator — two words — so a word with either is quoted. So is a word
 *   that starts with a digit, which PowerShell may read as a number (`1kb`, `0x10`), and one that starts with `-` but
 *   is not a plain option, which PowerShell may read as a parameter of its own and split (`-name.x`).
 * - A word that double quotes bring through all three readers whole goes in double quotes. Inside them cmd.exe reads
 *   `& | < > ^ ( )` and spaces as ordinary characters, and PowerShell reads everything as ordinary but `$`, the
 *   backtick and a double quote. What is left special in one or the other is kept out: a double quote, which ends the
 *   quoting in both — and PowerShell takes the curly ones, `“ ” „`, for one too; `$` and the backtick, PowerShell's
 *   expansion and escape; `%`, which cmd.exe expands as `%NAME%` before it looks at quotes at all; `!`, which it
 *   expands as `!NAME!` inside quotes too wherever delayed expansion is on, and which then makes a `^` inside quotes an
 *   escape; and any control or formatting character — a line break ends the command in cmd.exe even inside quotes, a
 *   tab pasted into cmd.exe can complete a file name, and a right-to-left override shows a line other than the one
 *   that runs. Three more cannot come through: an empty word, which Windows PowerShell drops; a word ending in a
 *   backslash, which the C runtime reads with the closing quote as `\"` — and doubled for it, PowerShell 7 passes both
 *   backslashes on where cmd.exe and Windows PowerShell pass one; and a word with `& | < > ^ ( )` but no whitespace,
 *   which PowerShell passes to a `.cmd` script unquoted, for cmd.exe to run `&whoami` from or to split at `|`.
 * - With any other word in it, no line is printed at all (`line` is null), and the printers show the command's words
 *   as JSON instead, saying it has to be typed. Not a line with the word left out: a placeholder in its place was
 *   still a command that ran — `claude mcp remove NAME` removed whatever entry was called `NAME`, and an install
 *   hint's `--force` replaced it — and before that, a word quoted for PowerShell's single quotes, which cmd.exe reads
 *   as characters, ran `whoami` from a server named `$x&whoami&`. See `commandAsJson` for why the JSON runs nothing.
 *
 * - The program itself has to be left as it is. Quoted, it is a string to PowerShell rather than a command — PowerShell
 *   runs a quoted program only after `&`, which cmd.exe reads as the end of a command — so a program whose path needs
 *   quotes, as `C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe` does, leaves the command with no line either (CUE-403).
 *
 * Everywhere else there is always a line: single quotes make any word safe.
 *
 * Not a way to make a command for a person: what it returns is not one, and nothing that shows a command takes it. One
 * of this suite's own commands comes from `locateCliCommand`, any other program's from `externalCommand`, and each of
 * them quotes its words here.
