/**
 * A command for a person to run that is not this suite's: `chmod`, or an MCP client's own `claude mcp …` and
 * `codex mcp …` (design 2026-10-04, D5).
 *
 * Every command printed for a person is one of two kinds. One of this suite's own CLIs is a `PrintedCommand`, which
 * only the locator makes (`cli-command.ts`): it names this Node and a checked file of the product, because a bare
 * `agent-gmail` is not on the PATH of most people it is printed for (CUE-403). Anything else is an `ExternalCommand`,
 * made here and nowhere else, with the reason that program is one a person may be told to run.
 *
 * So that this is not a way round the locator, `externalCommand` refuses words that would start one of this suite's
 * products by another route: a word containing one of the suite's commands — in any case, alone, as a path's last
 * part or inside a wrapper's payload (`sh -c "agent-gmail …"`) — a word naming a package of the suite
 * (`npx @agentcomms/gmail`), or a path inside the root of a suite package, as written or through a link
 * (`node …/packages/gmail/dist/cli.mjs`). Every word is looked at, not only the first: the program is often a wrapper.
 *
 * This module is a leaf: it reads the manifests' facts and the files a path names, and imports nothing that registers,
 * scans or locates, so nothing it refuses can be routed back through it.
