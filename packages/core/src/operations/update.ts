/**
 * Bringing a machine to the latest release, from a terminal (`agentcomms update`) or a chat (`comms_update`).
 *
 * A registration pins an exact version, so a new release reaches a client only when it is registered again — which
 * until now only a channel's own `mcp install --force`, run from that release, could do: the core server registers
 * servers at its own version. This reads the npm registry for the latest release, finds everything on this machine
 * that is behind it — every client's registration of each channel, the managed runtimes those need, and the global
 * packages that are installed — and makes one change of it, approved like every other: each registration registered
 * again at the latest version with exactly the name, client, scope, launcher and pins it has, each runtime that needs
 * installing, and each global package updated.
 *
 * The check reads and asks nobody. The update is a change whose effects are every step, one sentence each, so the
 * approval is bound to exactly that list — the versions in it included: a release published between the question and
 * the yes is a different change, and the claim is refused. Nothing behind, nothing is prepared.
