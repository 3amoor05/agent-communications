 * Changing a workspace — connecting it, signing it in again, moving its mode, setting its policies, removing it — as

 *
 * Each is a `GatedChange` from core: `plan` says what would change, from the configuration as it stands, and `apply`
 * does it with whatever consent the approval gave. Core's flow decides whether anybody has to agree. A change that
 * loosens nothing and does nothing that cannot be taken back is applied at once — renewing a grant, narrowing,
 * tightening a policy, connecting a workspace that can only read. One that loosens — connecting or widening a
 * workspace to `send`, loosening a policy — or removes something is prepared as a change approval, which a person
 * gives in the conversation under the `chat` change policy or at a terminal under `confirm`, and applied on the call
 * that claims it. Both surfaces ask the same way because both run these.
 *
 * What stays the person's whatever the surface: Slack's consent screen, which every sign-in here stops at and returns
 * the link to; and the app's declared scopes, which only its manifest page or an app configuration token can change.

       * Removal deletes a credential and then drops the entry naming it, and a migration running in between saw an
       * account still configured whose credential was already gone — skipped it as having nothing to copy, switched
       * backends, and left the removal refusing because the backend had moved. The account stayed configured with
       * its credential in neither backend. Holding the lock makes the two strictly one after the other, and reading
       * the configuration inside it means the store chosen is the one actually in force.
       *
       * A sign-in does not take it, deliberately: it only ever *adds* a reference, which the migration's own check of
       * the reference set does see, and the sign-in checks the backend from its side. Making it wait here would spend
       * a one-shot authorisation code on a five-second lock timeout.
