 * such shape: `chat.postMessage` and `conversations.history` are the same URL with a different last segment, and
 * the research found four separate ways to put a message in front of people, only one of which needs `chat:write`.
 * A guard that looked for one of them would be a guard against that one.
 *
 * So the rule is a list rather than a pattern, and the list is closed: a method that is not written down here
 * cannot be called at all. That is what makes "every write goes through the gate" checkable instead of hopeful —
 * a new method added anywhere in this package fails at the transport until somebody classifies it, and
 * classifying it is the moment to ask whether it posts.
 */

 * was classified `read` and sent — with the workspace's token attached. The method name is the last path
 * segment, and any host can offer that path.
 *
 * Tests reach Slack through an injected base URL instead of relaxing this, so there is no mode in which the

 * of a file's bytes to the exact upload URL `files.getUploadURLExternal` returned, inside a grant for that URL
 * (`uploadWith` in `guard.ts`), which opens only inside the approved post the file belongs to.
 *
 * Unlike Resend's attachment CDN, this host needs the workspace's token: Slack documents that both `url_private` and
 * `url_private_download` answer only a request carrying `Authorization: Bearer` with a token that has `files:read`.
