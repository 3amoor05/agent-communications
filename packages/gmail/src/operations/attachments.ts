/**
 * Finding and downloading attachments.
 *
 * Nothing here is ever opened or executed, and nothing is saved until the person has said where. Files arrive from
 * strangers: a name can contain path separators, a right-to-left override that makes `exe` look like `pdf`, a leading
 * dot that makes it a project's configuration, the name of a file already there — or a sentence. So a download asks
 * first (core's `save-destination.ts`), and saves only into the folder the person chose, under the name the sender
 * gave the file made safe by `savedName` — with `.download` after it unless its extension is one that is only ever
 * opened — and marks it as downloaded from the internet; the write is `O_EXCL` and refuses to follow a link. What the
 * sender called the file comes back beside the path, wrapped as untrusted content, and so do the subject and the type
 * they declared — and the saved name and path too, unless the name is plainly a file name.
