/**
 * A draft: the text, and a link that opens WhatsApp with it filled in. **The person presses send.**
 *
 * This is the whole of sending in this package, and it sends nothing. There is no WhatsApp client here to send with —
 * no session, no socket, no network module — so "may draft, may not send" is not a policy this code enforces; it is
 * the only thing the code can do. The link is WhatsApp's own click-to-chat: `https://wa.me/<number>?text=…` in a
 * browser, `whatsapp://send?phone=<number>&text=…` straight into the app. Either one fills the message box and stops.
 *
 * The recipient is a phone number or any chat id `chats` prints. A group has no number, so no link can open it with
 * text filled in; the draft then comes back as text to paste. So does a chat with someone who hides their number
 * (`@lid`), a broadcast list and a channel. A status update is refused: it is a post, not a chat anyone writes to.

 * the text, and whether the recipient is something a message can be written to at all — is checked first. Then, while
 * the lists hide anything, a draft goes only to a chat an agent could read: one in the index and visible, answered
 * word for word as `read` answers a chat that does not exist when it is not. Otherwise "not found" for a hidden number
 * and a link for any other would say which numbers the person hid. While the lists hide nothing there is nothing to
 * give away, and any number is drafted to, in the index or not.
 *
 * Which lists: the named account's — a pinned server's is named whether the call names it or not — or, with none
 * named, every account's, since the draft could be meant for any. And on a server that is not pinned, **every
 * account's deny list, always**: a draft is a link to a number, not to an account, so a number the person denied on
 * one account is not drafted to by naming another. A pinned server serves its account alone and consults no other.
